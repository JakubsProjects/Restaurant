# Restaurant
This is a program called Restaurant. Here you have similar functions as you would working in a restaurant. 
Some of them are, add table, delete table, call ahead, etc.


q - to quit the program
? - to list the accepted commands
a <size> <name> - to add a group to the wait list
c <size> <name> - to add a call-ahead group to the wait list
w <name> - to specify a call-ahead group is now waiting in the restaurant
r <table-size> - to retrieve the first waiting group that can fit at the available table size
l <name> - list how many groups are ahead of the named group
d - display the wait list information

The program waits for input. So for example you can do " a 4 David" and this adds a customer David who is in line waiting for a seat of 4. 

This programw as implemented using struct(typedef struct) and linked list.
